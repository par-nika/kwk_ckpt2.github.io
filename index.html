            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              Right now, I'm in the middle of a gap year, trying to figure out the answer to the craziest question for me: "What do I <b><i>actually</b></i> want to build in this life?‚Äù
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm an aspiring developer, event organizer, and part-time existential overthinker. I love teaching others to code, leading hackathons, and working on creative projects. <br>
              When I'm not knee-deep in code or spreadsheets, you'll find me cooking away my stress, reading rom-coms with suspiciously emotional depth, or watching long video essays on F1 and film theory.

          <h2>My KwK & Coding Journey</h2>
          <p>
            My first year with Kode With Klossy was as a 2021, virtual Web development summer scholar. In 2023, I was a part of the Data Science Curriculum. This is my third time in a KWK program, <i> and I'm so excited </i>!!!!!
          </p>
          <p> 
            Besides KWK, I self taught myself coding using online resources and a lot of <i>rubberducking</i>. 
            <br>
            Over time, I fell in love not just with writing code, but with building tech-communities where others could learn too. I founded my school's first computer science club, led web dev workshops, organized high school hackathons, and won a few competitions along the way. Right now, I'm interning as a software development intern and working on personal passion projects.
